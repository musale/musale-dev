When it comes to nice things ‚Äì like you ‚Äì I like them too. Now, you don't have to go through a difficult time trying to figure out what you want to buy for me :grin:.

## Books

I'm an [avid reader](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale). My reading taste ranges from romantic, adventure, biographies up to technical and non-technical all the way to any genre that will pique my interest. I read quite a lot. Now, in no particular order, here is a list of books I'd like to read:

- [Composing Software](https://leanpub.com/composingsoftware) by Eric Elliot. This is technical read which explores functional programming and object composition in JavaScript. I like Eric alot, having read his previous books and blog articles, I really can't wait to put my hands on this one.

- [Go, The Standard Library](https://leanpub.com/go-thestdlib) by Daniel Huckstep. Okay, this one is a technical one too that covers the most of Go's standard library. I like Go, I code in it and this one is getting me excited at exploring the language itself.
- **A Philosophy of Software Design** by John Ousterhout.
- **Talent is Overrated** by Geoffrey Colvin.
- **Refactoring** by Martin Fowler.

## Technology

On here, the options range from gadgets, hardware and software. Also, in no particular order:

- [MacBook Pro 2019 16-inch](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch). I like it.
- [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com). It's the paper tablet. Perfect for writing and reading. You can actually write [scripts](https://github.com/jessfraz/morningpaper2remarkable) to sync content into it! How :cool:!
- [Dell 43 Ultra HD 4K Multi Client Monitor.](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-43-ultra-hd-4k-multi-client-monitor-p4317q/apd/210-ahsq/monitors-monitor-accessories) Now this is productivity unchained.

## Miscellaneous

These are various stuff which don't need a category. Still, they are in no particular order:

- Tickets to a **Rihanna** concert. I already have my budget for this but just in case, LOL!
- Tickets to a Manchester United game at Old Trafford. Despite their shitty perfomance lately ~~as of 2019-11-25~~ I still want to grace the _Theatre of Dreams_.
- [The Spirit of St. Louis Amorgan Wrist Watch](https://www.armogan.com/us/all-watches-straps/watches/spirit-of-st-louis). I like the dull-colored ones. I wrote a [script](https://github.com/musale/armogan) to monitor the price üòÅ.
