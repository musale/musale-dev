# Hello stranger!

I'm Martin Musale, a Software Developer based in Nairobi, Kenya. Currently, I work at `Microsoft` in the `Graph Developer Experiences` team where I build ~~and break~~ [Graph](https://aka.ms/graph) Developer Tools. I mostly work on the [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](https://aka.ms/mgt). You can see some of the other stuff I work on in [GitHub](https://github.com/musale).

When I'm not working, I like [writing](/thoughts), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale). I maintain these websites:

- [localusr.com](https://localusr.com) where I write about Software Development and issues that developers(me) face while at it.
- [riotbytes.com](https://riotbytes.com) where I write about the web and my findings in developing it.

Out of the office, you can find me playing football, traveling, and exploring with my friends.

I'm open for consultation and part-time work, you can reach me on email at martinmshale@gmail.com or see my [contacts page](/contacts)
