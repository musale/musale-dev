# Hello stranger!

I’m Musale Martin – a learner, problem-solver, and software engineer from Kenya, based in Nairobi.

I'm currently building ~~and breaking~~ software at `Microsoft` in the `M365 Core` team.

Previously, I was with the `Automation and Data Pipelining` team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). We were helping businesses to know their regulations by collecting, tagging, summarising, and giving them notifications about the law when it changes.

Before that, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth), and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) – where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

In my free time, I contribute to open source projects. I'm a maintainer at [Encode](https://www.encode.io/) where we aim to develop the highest quality open-source software. I mostly programming in [Python](https://python.org) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/), but I enjoy [Go](https://golang.org/) and also learning new languages. My favorites typically change over time.

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics & Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem-solving.
Currently, I'm into web development and distributed systems.

When I'm not programming the web, I listen to music, I [write](/thoughts), travel, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13682301-mr-musale), and I imagine myself exercise.
