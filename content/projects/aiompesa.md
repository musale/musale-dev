summary: "[aiompesa](aiompesa/) is a Python library that I wrote which allows you to interact with Python's _asyncio_ library. MPESA is a service that allows you to make money transactions using your mobile phone. [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) is a library that allows you to write concurrent code in Python using `async/await` pattern."

## Motivation

The reason I wrote this library is because:

1. I wanted to learn some more about _asyncio_.
2. To create an asynchronous library.
3. Experiment with Python 3+ static typing.

## Results

I understand a little more about _asyncio_ and the various IO problems that it is trying to solve. Maybe you might not need to make async M-Pesa calls now in your product but, it's something you can consider in future. The _aiompesa_ library is available on _pypy_ and open sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/musale/aiompesa). For more information on how to use it you can read about it's usage [here](https://aiompesa.readthedocs.org) and test it out. Cheers! :beer:
