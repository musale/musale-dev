## Motivation

I bumped into [Ben Hoyt's](https://benhoyt.com/) website during my rounds on the internet. I liked the way the website is laid out. Since I have been looking for a proper layout for my personal website, I found the site to be exactly what I wanted. The reason I made it into a [hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme is because I used it for my site and it would be good to have one of them themes.

## Results

I created a hugo theme named [hoyt](https://github.com/musale/hoyt) ~for obvious reasons, d'uh~. It's still a work in progress and contributions are welcome in accordance to the standard guidelines of contributing to OSS. I'm looking to add more features and hopefully make this into a fully-fledged theme but for the time being, my fingers are crossed.
