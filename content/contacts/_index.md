# Work with me

I'm available to help you launch your startup, choose your tech stack, develop your application, or review your code.

Although I specialize in Go, Python and TypeScript, I have over 10 years experience building web applications, APIs and Web services using different languages and technologies. I value friendliness and kindness in interactions, and simplicity and clarity in code, architecture and workflows.

I speak both technology and business. I'm just as happy to talk with you about return on investment as relational databases. In fact, where the two areas meet is where I like to work most.

## What I can help you with
**CTO-level planning for your project or startup** — You can hire me to help you define the requirements for your project, pick the right technology stack, and architect the infrastructure. I can help create both high-level roadmaps and detailed technical specifications to turn your vision into reality.

**Software development** — I can work with you to write the code for your web applications, APIs and RPC services. I'm proficient with Go and Python/Django.

**Code review** — If you'd like an experienced second set of eyes to go over your Go code then I'm happy to help.

## How it works
To start with, we'll schedule a video call to discuss what you want to accomplish and then we can move forward from there. Sessions start at one hour.

I only take on consultancy work where I'm positive that it's a good fit for both you and me, and I'm confident that I'll be able to provide support in the long term if needed. I'm a native English speaker and wherever you are in the world, I'm happy to work remotely with you.
