summary: "[The Advent of Code 2019](/thoughts/aoc19/) has my thoughts about the daily [exercises](https://adventofcode.com/) which I'm currently attempting to solve with both _Go_ and _Python 3_."

# Motivation

I always like solving problems and this is a very nice place to practise my skills. This year, I would like to learn more concepts and I'm already liking this _AOC_. First, I'm liking the way [Jonathan Paulson's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuWLIm0l4sDpEe28t41WITA/videos) videos. Precise and really nice to see. I also like [Liz Fong-Jones'](https://www.twitch.tv/lizthegrey) _Go_ solutions. My solutions are over [here](https://github.com/musale/advent-of-code-2019).

## Day 7

**Amplifiers**! This puzzle builds up from the [day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5) `IntCode` puzzle. There's multi processing in part 2 which really had me in a mind blown state. For some reason ~~which I don't know~~ I just find it difficult understanding the int code puzzles. I managed to do the first part but translating that to part 2 became a bit of a challenge. One thing I learnt how to tackle it was to make the code I'm running more clear. I came across a solution by [alcatrazEscapee](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/AdventofCode/blob/master/2019/day7/day7.py) and reading through his code made me understand the puzzle even better. I hope day 8 is easy on me :laugh:.

## Day 6

Yay! A simple puzzle. We had ourselves a tree and traversals. This was a bit easy to do. Also, the illustrations make it really easy to think through your solutions.

## Day 5

**Good Lord!** This is by far the most difficult of the puzzles. For starters, it uses day 2's code. Then the theory is just a lot. My brain got lost for a couple of hours here. I finally followed Jonathan Paulson's steps and managed to finesse it. Sigh

## Day 1 - 4

These exercises were pretty simple and straightforward. [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1) exercises involved summing values, pretty easy. [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) had some splitting values given a certain step and then doing different arithmetic and end up with a final value. That was pretty easy to do too.

[Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3) came with Manhattan distance. Owh, this one was nice... I'm still unable to do the visualizations and it's one thing that I found out people are doing with their solutions. It's fantastic seeing people doing these.

[Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4) was _brute force_ day. Genarating values in a given range and using different criteria to determine the values you need and then make a final value.
