    description = """I’m Musale Martin – a learner, problem-solver and software engineer from Kenya, based in Nairobi.

I graduated with a BS in Mathematics & Computer Science from [Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology](http://www.jkuat.ac.ke/), where I developed my love for technology and problem solving.

I’m currently with the Automation and Data Pipelining team at [Libryo](https://libryo.com). We’re making Law easily accesible, readable and always updated on our platform.

Previously, I was with [Optimetriks](https://optimetriks.com), [Gravity](https://gravity.earth) and [Focus Mobile](https://smsleopard.com) where I helped to make sending bulk SMSs faster and more efficient.

When I'm not doing server configurations, I listen to music ~~and you can tell I love Rihanna :wink:~~, I write, travel, read, and I imagine myself exercise.

Currently, I'm into interpreters, compilers and how programming languages work."""
